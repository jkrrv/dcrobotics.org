<h1>DC Middle School Robotics</h1>

<p>The just created in January 2011, the middle school program is the newest addition to DC Robotics.  Here the program differs a bit from the high school method.  In middle school, students are first taught the basics of how a robot works and what a program can do, according to the Intellitek Curriculum for VEX Robotics.  After a few weeks of learning fundamentals, Middle school students will begin crafting new robots according to their own designs.  Guided by experienced high school students and advisor, Christy Ware, these DC teams will compete at the next event to be hosted by DC near the end of March.</p>
<p>Next year, the middle school program will have a more regular season, developing and competing through the entire season.</p>
